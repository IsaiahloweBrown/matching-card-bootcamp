I made matching card game based on Legend of Runterra(League of Legends Lore)

**Link to project:** coming soon



## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

The matching card game allows you to click two cards. If the cards are the same, they stay facing up. If they are different they turn back over. Once, you matched all the cards, the game reset and randomizes all the cards. 


## Additional Features:

- Background changes randomly every few seconds

- The card sleeves change every time the game resets 



## Lessons Learned:

I learned that coding is not about taking one approach but instead coding is about considering your options and taking steps towards the best solution. I learned that every lesson is applicable to another lesson. For an example, I wrote my background changer similar to how I learn how to target multiple html elements(using forEach). Coding skills build on previous things learned.
